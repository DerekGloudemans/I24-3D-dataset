## Preliminaries


## Requirements
It's just data, there are no requirements...
But more realistically, if you want to use the utilities provided in this repository, you'll need some basic python libraries:


## TODO
- [X] Save annotations as flat file
- [X] Save homography data as flat file
- [X] Save spline object data as flat file
- [X] Save timestamps as flat file
- [X] Nest homgraphy code nicely
- [X] Update homography to use curve offset parameters and load from JSON
- [X] Implement CSV - dataloader
- [X] Implement JSON spline dataloader
- [X] Implement timestamp file dataloader
- [X] Make a simple DataHandler object that serves up annotations, timestamps and frames with sweet sweet precision and does basic things
- [X] Make a simple viz tool that shows objects, spline objects, masks, roadway grid, and object details
- [X] Make a no-handrails annotation tool

- [ ] Cache evaluation runs from database as files
- [ ] Get evaluation script to work with the above file structure
- [ ] Stash all previous code and data on a hard drive never to be seen or used again!
- [ ] Make a beautiful beautiful readme
- [ ] Update the manuscript
